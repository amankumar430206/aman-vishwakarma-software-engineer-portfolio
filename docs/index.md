### 👋 About Me

I’m a **Software Engineer** building
**fintech and enterprise-scale systems**.

I specialize in **frontend-heavy full-stack development**, owning products
from architecture and UI performance to cloud infrastructure and CI/CD.
Most of my work lives in **payments, neobanking, cross-border finance, and
high-traffic platforms**.

I enjoy solving hard problems, simplifying complex systems, and building
software that scales reliably.
