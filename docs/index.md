### 👋 About Me

I’m a **Software Engineer**, Full-stack wizard building scalable, high-stakes apps that actually work under pressure. I take end-to-end ownership, turning complex fintech systems into smooth, bulletproof user experiences.

I mentor, lead, and set standards, shipping code that’s clean, reliable, and impactful. Obsessed with performance, resilience, and results—I don’t just build software, I future-proof it.

I enjoy solving hard problems, simplifying complex systems, and building
software that scales reliably.
